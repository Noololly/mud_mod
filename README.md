This is my first mod, and it adds mud...
I mostly made this to help me learn Java. I will definitely keep making mods. 

It includes 2 types of mud: The mud balls, and the mud blocks.

I was trying to get the custom generation to work, but alas, I couldn't.
Instead I made the block obtainable by making the vanilla mud block craftable with a water bottle (making more slimey mud)

I have used this experience to learn how Fabric works, and I will be developing more mods in the future
Watch this space!!!
